# New Typing Game

# Introduction

My idea is an online typing game in which students can create their own typing courses and compete with one another. Tailoring it to high school students, users are encouraged to create typing courses by copy and pasting textbook passages, informational articles, etc. This is because typing games are often used to procrastinate studying, and combining the studying with the game will create a subconcious educational benefit to an addictive web game. Users will compete by aiming for higher words per minute high scores on their own courses as well as their friends' public courses. There will also be a live racing feature, in which they can race to the end of a course in live time.

# Value / Use

The value of this game is that it brings new functionality to an already successful website idea, which is speed typing. The introduction of being able to create your own typing courses and compete with friends on them allows users a new world of functionality. Users will be incentivised to imrpove their typing speeds by seeing their high scores and comparing it to friends, as well as being able to gain repetitive and simple practice on the website. Users can practice their typing by creating a typing "course" of an article, and then typing out that article as fast as they can. This activiates subconcious learning, in which the user will be having fun typing as fast as they can but also digesting the information in the back of their mind. Or, they can just have fun with the courses and create ones with the hardest words imaginable, or anything that comes to mind. The use is having fun, competing with friends, creating public courses (also competing for which course gets the most plays), and improving typing speeds.

# User Interaction and Experience

The user will have their own account, in which they can friend other users. There are three main elements to the experience, and they are as follows:

(bullet point) Course Creation: This is the new functionality that differentiates this typing game from others. Users will open a page for course creation, in which they just copy and paste or write out whatever text they choose. After they are finished, they can either publish it publicly or privately. It will simply be a bunch of text.

(bullet point) Typing: Users will do typing on a variety of texts. Mainly, they will be typing on courses that they have created or that other users have created. This means that they will be typing out the text inputted into the course creation as fast as they can. Just like any other typing game, the text will be shown in one color, and as the user types out the text, it will change colors to indicate that it has been typed out. There will also be a randomly generated word typing mode for practice. Also, there will be a racing mode, in which multiple users can join a live game, and race to the end of a course. This will be indicated by progress bars at the top of the screen to see where each user is at.

(bullet point) Statistics: Users will be able to see their typing speeds. There will be an average typing speed, along with a graph to show improvement. Then, there wil be typing speed high scores on each of the courses that the users have played, along with a leaderboard for each course as well as overall typing average, which will have a global option and a friends option.

The user interface will be minimalistic, with many options for changing color themes and profile pages. The main focus will be the text to be typed, and all other UI will be minimized. The feedback will be responsive and crisp.

# Competitive Element

The competitive element is within course creation and typing speeds. In terms of course creation, each user is competing to create a course that receives the most likes and plays. In terms of typing speeds, users are competing to have the highest typing average speed or typing speed on a certain course.
