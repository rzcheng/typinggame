# New Typing Game

## Introduction

An innovative online typing game where students can create their own typing courses and compete with one another. Tailored to high school students, the platform encourages them to craft typing courses using excerpts from textbooks or informational articles. This integration of learning and gameplay provides a subconscious educational benefit alongside the enjoyment of an addictive online game. Competition is fueled as users strive to achieve higher words per minute scores on both their own and friends' courses, bolstered by a live racing feature for real-time competition.

## Value / Use

The game introduces a novel functionality to the familiar concept of speed typing websites. By enabling users to create and compete on custom typing courses, it opens up a new realm of interactivity. The game serves as an incentive for users to improve their typing speeds by keeping track of high scores and allowing for constant practice. Whether the goal is subconscious learning while typing an article or simply enjoying the challenge of difficult words, the game is designed for fun, competition, and skill improvement.

## User Interaction and Experience

Users will have personal accounts with the ability to connect with friends. The platform's experience centers around three core interactions:

- **Course Creation**: Differentiating this game from others, users can create courses by simply inputting text, which can be published for public or private use.
- **Typing**: The core of the gameplay involves typing texts from self-created or others' courses as quickly as possible, with a visual color change indicating progress. Additionally, a random word mode and live racing mode provide varied typing challenges.
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive stats allow users to track their progress with average speeds, improvement graphs, and leaderboards for each course, fostering a competitive environment.

The UI prioritizes a minimalistic approach, with options for theme customization and a focus on the typing text for an uncluttered, responsive experience.

## Competitive Element

Competition is twofold: course creation and typing speeds. Users aim to create popular courses and achieve top typing speeds, with leaderboards for individual courses and overall averages enhancing the competitive atmosphere.

## Engagement and Addictiveness

The game's appeal lies in its responsive feedback and the continual pursuit of higher scores. With a high skill ceiling, there's substantial room for improvement, catering to the natural human desire for growth and achievement.

## Scalability and Expansion

The game is poised for growth, potentially evolving into a comprehensive typing hub. Expansions could include new game modes akin to CandyCrush's progression system or the integration of AI to auto-generate courses based on user prompts, like "create a course about mitochondria."

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

- **Design**: An accessible interface with clear navigation caters to all users.
- **Customization**: Options for visual adjustments support those with visual impairments.
- **Disabilities**: Compatibility with assistive technologies ensures inclusivity.
- **Languages**: Multiple language support broadens accessibility for non-English speakers.
