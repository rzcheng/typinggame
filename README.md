# Introduction

My idea is an online typing game in which students can create their own typing courses and compete with one another. Tailoring it to high school students, users are encouraged to create typing courses by copy and pasting textbook passages, informational articles, etc. This is because typing games are often used to procrastinate studying, and combining the studying with the game will create a subconcious educational benefit to an addictive web game. Users will compete by aiming for higher words per minute high scores on their own courses as well as their friends' public courses. There will also be a live racing feature, in which they can race to the end of a course in live time.
